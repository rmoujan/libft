# Libft

Libft : Your very first own library
This project focuses on building a custom C library by implementing numerous functions from scratch. It provided an opportunity to explore core programming concepts, including algorithms, memory handling, and data structures. Through this hands-on experience, I gained valuable insights into memory behavior, efficient data storage techniques, and the inner workings of C programming.
